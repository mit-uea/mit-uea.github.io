On Thursday, the UEA hosted a lunch event featuring Professor Nancy Rose. The event centered around a talk on competition policy, covering topics such as antitrust regulations, vertical integration, and mergers. Attendees were treated to Flour sandwiches while gaining insights into the intricate world of industrial organization from Professor Rose.

Professor Rose brought a wealth of experience to the table, drawing from her roles leading the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division and the National Bureau of Economics Research's IO department. Her expertise provided attendees with a deep understanding of the complexities within the field.

The timing of the event couldn't have been more opportune, given the current landscape of IO, which includes several high-profile cases. These cases, including Microsoft's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, Epic Game's lawsuit against Apple and Google, and Google's search and adtech antitrust lawsuits, sparked engaging discussions among attendees.

The event boasted an impressive turnout, with over 40 undergraduate students attending the entirety of the talk. Furthermore, attendees had the chance to engage with Professor Rose directly, posing questions and delving deeper into the subject matter.
